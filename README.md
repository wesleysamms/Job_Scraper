# 🧬 Bay Area MLE / DS Job Scraper

Three GitHub Actions workflows that scrape **software engineering, ML/AI, data science, data engineering, platform/infra/security, and biotech informatics roles** in the SF Bay Area, commit the results to the repo, and surface them in the [`triage.html`](#interactive-triage-dashboard--triagehtml) dashboard.

## What It Does

### 1. Biotech LinkedIn digest — daily at 8pm PT, last 24h
Hits LinkedIn's public guest endpoint for SF Bay Area MLE/DS roles posted in the last 24 hours, then post-filters results to a **biotech company allowlist** derived from `CURATED_BIOTECHS` in `scrape_jobs.py` (10x Genomics, Twist, Maze, Freenome, Cytokinetics, Natera, Inceptive, Atomwise, Profluent, Eikon, Altos Labs, Arc Institute, Caribou, Octant, Genentech, Gilead). Add to that list to expand coverage.

Output goes to `jobs.json`, `jobs.md`, and `jobs.html`. Each run dedupes against the previously-committed `jobs.json` so the output surfaces only postings new since the last run.

> Why allowlist instead of LinkedIn's industry filter? The `f_I` industry parameter is silently ignored on the public guest endpoint (verified by probing IDs 12, 14, 16, 1763, 1862 — all returned identical non-biotech results).

### 2. LinkedIn MLE/DS watcher — every 2 hours, last 2h
Hits LinkedIn's public guest endpoint for SF Bay Area roles posted in **the last 2 hours** across multiple search terms, dedupes by job ID, and sorts by recency. Output goes to `linkedin_jobs.json`, `linkedin_jobs.md`, and `linkedin_jobs.html`.

Runs every 2 hours from **8am to 10pm Pacific time**. Cron is fixed in UTC; in PST (UTC-8) the schedule shifts to 7am–9pm PT — acceptable seasonal drift. Each run dedupes against the previous run so empty windows produce no new listings.

> ⚠️ Uses the unauthenticated public guest endpoint only — **never** signs in with a user account and does not use LinkedIn cookies, tokens, or credentials.

### 3. Indeed MLE/DS watcher — every 1h, last 24h
Uses [`python-jobspy`](https://pypi.org/project/python-jobspy/) (Indeed's public RSS and Publisher API were both deprecated in 2026; the site sits behind Cloudflare's top-tier bot product, so stdlib `urllib` is blocked at the edge). JobSpy uses Indeed's mobile-app API internally — no proxies required, no documented rate limit. Output goes to `indeed_jobs.json`, `indeed_jobs.md`, and `indeed_jobs.html`, deduped against the previous run.

Scheduled externally by cron-job.org at :47 PT, offset from the LinkedIn :17 slot to reduce contention on the shared commit-push concurrency group.

## Output Files

| File | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `jobs.json` / `.md` / `.html` | Biotech LinkedIn digest | Allowlisted biotech-company roles in the last 24h, deduped against the previous run |
| `linkedin_jobs.json` / `.md` / `.html` | LinkedIn watcher | Roles posted in the last 2h, deduped against the previous run |
| `indeed_jobs.json` / `.md` / `.html` | Indeed watcher | Indeed-sourced roles posted in the last 24h, deduped against the previous run |
| `checked_companies.json` | (legacy) | Tracking file from earlier Wikipedia-based discovery |

The `.html` files are styled standalone digests; the `.md` files render nicely on GitHub. (Both are committed for history/browsing; the `triage.html` dashboard reads the `.json` files directly.)

Both workflows keep a GitHub history of generated digests: result files are committed when changed, and each scheduled workflow still runs `git push`.

### Interactive triage dashboard — `triage.html`

A single-file dashboard hosted on GitHub Pages that merges all three latest source JSONs into one filterable cockpit: search, role/seniority/source filters, save/applied/dismiss buttons persisted in localStorage, top-companies + role-mix charts, and an "export saved as Claude prompt" action.

**View it:** [`https://ernestod1998.github.io/Job_Scraper/triage.html`](https://ernestod1998.github.io/Job_Scraper/triage.html)

The dashboard fetches `jobs.json` / `linkedin_jobs.json` / `indeed_jobs.json` from the same repo at view time, so it always reflects the latest committed scrape. Refresh in the browser to see new data after a cron fire (Pages serves with ~1–2 min lag after each push). No bake-on-cron step in the scraper — `triage.html` is committed once and never modified by automation.

To run locally (e.g. to edit the dashboard UI):
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000/triage.html
```
Opening from `file://` won't work — the dashboard needs same-origin HTTP to `fetch()` the source JSONs.

## Setup

### Triage secrets (for the nightly fit-scoring agent)

The scraper workflows need no secrets. The nightly triage workflow (`triage.yml`) reads
these from **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key used by `triage_agent.py` |
| `CANDIDATE_PROFILE` | Candidate profile text (kept out of the public repo) |
| `CANDIDATE_RESUME` | Resume text (kept out of the public repo) |

### Run manually

From the **Actions** tab:
- *Biotech MLE Job Scraper* → Run workflow (biotech LinkedIn, last 24h)
- *LinkedIn MLE/DS Watcher* → Run workflow (general LinkedIn, last 2h)
- *Indeed MLE/DS Watcher* → Run workflow (Indeed via python-jobspy, last 24h)

Or locally:
```bash
python scrape_jobs.py --biotech-only   # biotech LinkedIn, last 24h, allowlist-filtered
python scrape_jobs.py --linkedin-only  # general MLE/DS LinkedIn, last 2h
python scrape_jobs.py --indeed-only    # general MLE/DS Indeed, last 24h (requires python-jobspy)
python scrape_jobs.py                  # legacy curated Greenhouse/Workday/Phenom sweep
```

Biotech and LinkedIn pipelines use only the standard library. The Indeed pipeline requires `pip install -r requirements.txt` (single dep: `python-jobspy`).
